# terraform

assuming terraform is installed, as described in the [initial setup](./initial-setup.md) document, you want to initialise it first, then run the changes

```shell
terraform init
terraform apply
```

then if you want to burn everything down and restart from scratch

```shell
terraform destroy
```
